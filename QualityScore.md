Perfect — since you have a **FastAPI backend** to do the heavy lifting, you can gradually expand from lightweight, rule-based checks to heavier ML-based heuristics. Below I’ve drafted a **roadmap** that ranks ideas from **easy+useful** (things you can implement right away) to **harder+less critical**.

# 📊 Dataset Quality Dashboard Roadmap

## ✅ Phase 1: Quick Wins (Rule-based, lightweight, very useful)

These can be computed directly from metadata, schema, or simple text stats.

* **Row/column counts** (already implemented)
* **Missing values per column** (% null/empty per column, highlight >10%)
* **Duplicate checks**

  * Duplicate IDs
  * Duplicate text entries
* **Token stats**

  * Min/mean/max token count (already have some of this)
  * Histogram / boxplot of token lengths
* **File consistency**

  * Check for schema drift (e.g., type mismatch)
  * Validate timestamp formats (`created`, `added`)
* **Encoding issues**

  * Detect invalid UTF-8 or “�” replacement chars

👉 *Why*: These are quick, provide immediate insight, and form the backbone of your “quality score”.
👉 *Effort*: Low, can mostly use Polars + Python standard libs.

---

## ⚡ Phase 2: Richer Rule-based Heuristics (Moderate effort, still very useful)

Adds more nuance to text datasets, still deterministic.

* **Outlier detection**

  * Rows with token count beyond 99th percentile
  * Extremely short (<5 tokens) or long (>10k tokens) entries
* **Noise checks**

  * High proportion of non-alphabetic characters
  * Excessive repetition (e.g., same word repeated many times)
  * Detect rows that look like HTML, code, or logs
* **Per-column insights**

  * % unique values per column (e.g., `source` diversity)
  * Cardinality check (suspiciously low/high number of distinct values)
* **Basic language distribution**

  * Use `langdetect` or `fasttext` to count rows per language
  * Highlight mismatch if dataset has declared language(s)

👉 *Why*: Surfaces subtle quality problems (spammy rows, wrong data type, etc.).
👉 *Effort*: Moderate, requires some parsing + heuristics.

---

## 🤖 Phase 3: ML-based Light Quality Checks (More effort, high value)

Use lightweight ML models to surface issues beyond rules.

* **Language validation**

  * Detect language with ML (fastText or CLD3) and compare to metadata
* **Fluency / readability score**

  * Flesch–Kincaid or ML-based fluency classifier
* **Toxicity / offensive content detection**

  * Small toxicity classifier (e.g., DistilBERT-based)
* **Content type classifier**

  * Detect whether text looks like *natural language* vs. *code/logs/HTML*
* **Semantic duplicates**

  * Embedding-based clustering → detect near-duplicates

👉 *Why*: Catches subtle quality issues not obvious via rules.
👉 *Effort*: Moderate to high, but can be offloaded to FastAPI with preloaded models.

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Advanced ML-based Analysis (High effort, nice-to-have)

These are heavier, potentially expensive, but provide the deepest insights.

* **Quality scoring model**

  * Train or use an existing LLM-based model that predicts *text quality* (clarity, coherence, usefulness)
* **Hallucination / nonsense detection**

  * Classify text as meaningful vs. gibberish
* **Bias / safety checks**

  * Detect personal data (names, emails, phone numbers → PII risk)
  * Detect gender/race bias signals
* **Temporal trends**

  * Track text characteristics over time (if dataset has temporal columns)
* **Cross-dataset overlap**

  * Check if dataset has significant duplication with other datasets (requires corpus-level embeddings)

👉 *Why*: High research/engineering value, but not always needed in the first version.
👉 *Effort*: High, requires model hosting + optimization for performance.

# 🗂️ Dashboard Structure to Support This Roadmap

* **Overview tab** → dataset-level score + top 3 issues (quick wins)
* **Schema tab** → column-specific missing/nullable info
* **Sample Data tab** → view random, shortest, longest, or “problematic” rows
* **Analysis tab** → histograms, boxplots, distributions (rule-based stats)
* **Quality tab (future)** → ML-based checks (language mix, toxicity, duplicates, etc.)

# 🛠️ Suggested Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)** → Missing values, duplicates, token length stats (done in days).
2. **Phase 2 (Heuristic Expansion)** → Outliers, noise checks, basic language detection (1–2 weeks).
3. **Phase 3 (ML Checks)** → Language validation, fluency/toxicity classifiers (ongoing, modular).
4. **Phase 4 (Advanced)** → LLM-based quality scoring, semantic overlap, PII/bias detection (optional, research-driven).
